Over the break, I had the time to do even more research. And during that time I came across this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQH4273wy7w)which helped re-explained some of the things I learned about Babylon and also learn something.

Along with the youtube video i found i also found this [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/Building_up_a_basic_demo_with_Babylon.js?utm_campaign) which like the video gives a basscicy of Babbylon but also code sinppets that i can follow along and create,this ends up being a 3D square.
