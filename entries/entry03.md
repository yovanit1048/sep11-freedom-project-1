Over the break, I had the time to do even more research. And during that time I came across this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQH4273wy7w)which helped re-explained some of the things I learned about Babylon and also learn something.

Along with the youtube video i found i also found this [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/Building_up_a_basic_demo_with_Babylon.js?utm_campaign) which like the video gives a basscicy of Babbylon but also code sinppets that i can follow along and create,this ends up being a 3D square.


# Engineering Design Process(EDP)

I'm currently at stage 4 Engineering Design Process: the most promising solution. I’m starting to plan over the best solutions for my project from what I’ve learned and re-learned over the course of this project I’m trying to still see what other thing out there can help me better understand Babylon and planning over what the best course of action that I will take for this project. The other plan is ways how I can make a 3D feel like the user can actually be there and experience and also plan what I will require to learn everything that Babylon offers and make a project to the best of my ability.

For the next stage Create a prototype, I plan to make a simple background with lighting and a couple of shapes which will not be that difficult since over my time doing research on Babylon those were demos and beginners steps that were recommended for people starting to work on Babylon. I will take the time until the next  entry to use what I’ve learned and make apply that to a small prototype that will display what I’ve learned and also along the way would like still to learn about possibles ways to better improve my small prototype.
