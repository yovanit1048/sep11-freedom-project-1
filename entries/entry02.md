After having days and hours of doing [research](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative) and other [soruce](https://doc.babylonjs.com/toolsAndResources/offsite) and having a feel for it,I have decide on [Babylon](https://www.babylonjs.com/community/) as my primary tool.An example of how Babylon can be used to make a 3D environment is by this code 'scene.clearColor = BABYLON.Color3.Blue();' 


The problem im trying to slove by using Babylon is snice people are stuck inside their homes i want to bring a the outside world to home so they can rember how good outside is.And how nauture can be nice from time to time.


By using Babylon i would use it to create a 3D environment which will either a forest witha water fall next to it or a city from a birds eye view looking down.
