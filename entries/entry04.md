Last week, I had time to review the next steps that I wrote on my EDP(Engineering Design Process), making a prototype with lighting and camera POV. Which today I came across this video's helping me understand both [Cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cib3Y64GVWE) and [Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fTS5W0RPkc). These videos helped me understand the basics of what I need to start with and were the foundation of my project because of how they are needed to start anything that is created in Babylon.


# Engineering Design Process(EDP)

I'm currently at stage 5 Engineering Design Process: Create a Prototype. I've used the planning from stage 4 of the EDP and further research to start to create a [Prototpe](https://playground.babylonjs.com/). I’m currently at stage 5 Engineering Design Process: Create a Prototype. I’ve used the planning from stage 4 of the EDP and further research to start to create a [Prototpe](https://playground.babylonjs.com/). The prototype is a playground where Babylon has provided the user with a starter code and it’s up to me to start to tinker with add my ideas that I’ve learned from the past change around the code to fit my liking. I will also use the MVP plan to start the code little by little making small changes that will coincide with what I’ve made.

For the next stage Test and evaluate the prototype
